"The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported. thither"
